## [HACKATHON BBVA - ML API Project](https://github.com/Rasecode/Hackathon_BBVA)<br>
The aim of this machine learning project was to develop a solution to detect occupancy levels in BBVA's office spaces. The solution involved implementing a machine learning algorithm for customer detection and creating a landing page on the BBVA website to allow customers to access occupancy information without the need for additional links. The project was the winning entry in the BBVA WeCode 2022 hackathon.

### Stack: Flask, PyTorch, Docker, GCP, MySQL, Git, Trello, JavaScript.

## [ML API Project](https://github.com/Rasecode/ML_project)<br>
The ML project aims to develop an API that provides the probability of suffering a heart disease based on a machine learning model. The project will use a machine learning model trained on a dataset from Kaggle that uses LightGBM with Encoder. The project will use the BentoML ML API framework, as well as GCP Cloud Run and Docker for deployment. The LightGBM package will be used for machine learning model training and prediction. The expected outcome of the project is an API that can be used to predict the probability of heart disease given certain input data.

### Stack: BentoML, LightGBM, Docker, GCP Cloud Run.
